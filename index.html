    		This is a fantastic little painting. You can create beautiful things - but you have to see them in your mind first. Now it's beginning to make a little sense.
		</p>
    	<p>
    		You can work and carry-on and put lots of little happy things in here. The man who does the best job is the one who is happy at his job. It's a very cold picture, I may have to go get my coat. Itâ€™s about to freeze me to death. Every single thing in the world has its own personality - and it is up to you to make friends with the little rascals. A little happy sunlight shining through there. All you have to do is let your imagination go wild.
